The Sheep and Wolves problem is an artificial intelligence (AI) game in which a shepherd must transport a certain number of sheep and wolves across a river using a boat, under the following constraints:

At no point can the number of wolves on either side of the river exceed the number of sheep, to prevent attacks.

Wolves are allowed to be alone on either riverbank.

The boat can carry either one or two animals at a timeâ€”no more, no less. In this variation of the game we find the optimal way of transporting sheep and wolves for X number of sheep and Y number of wolves. The unit tests are testing with various combinations. The max number of sheep and wolves tested is 1000000 sheep and 900000 wolves.

The code returns the sequence of trips to take. Therefore you can see what trips were taken and how many trips were taken.
